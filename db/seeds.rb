It was founded by war surgeon Gino Strada in 1994 in Milan (Italy). Gino Strada and the other founders of Emergency aimed to bring free, high-quality medical and surgical assistance to war victims. Over time, their humanitarian projects assumed a broader view, including giving human rights to those who suffer the social consequences from wars. Emergency promotes a culture of peace and solidarity. Emergency strives for neutrality in every war; its aim is to guarantee the right of free medical assistance to the population affected by a war. Today Emergency is active in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Iraq, Sierra Leone, Sudan and Sri Lanka. Emergency’s humanitarian projects usually involve construction, support, and operation of permanent hospitals. However, Emergency has also given short-term emergency assistance to existing hospitals in areas with a critical need for temporary care by providing specialized personnel, drugs or instruments. These short-term projects have included Algeria, Angola, Eritrea, Nicaragua, Palestine and Serbia. As of 2013, more than six million people have received care from Emergency health centers.", website:"www.emergencyuk.org", facebook_profile:"emergency", twitter_profile:"emergency.ong", role: "charity", email: "emergency@emergency.it", password: "password", password_confirmation: "password", profile_picture: open("./public/img/emergency_logo.png")

Amnesty International was founded in London in 1961, following the publication of the article 'The Forgotten Prisoners' in The Observer on 28 May 1961, by the lawyer Peter Benenson. Amnesty draws attention to human rights abuses and campaigns for compliance with international laws and standards. It works to mobilise public opinion to put pressure on governments that let abuse take place. The organisation was awarded the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize for its 'campaign against torture,' and the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights in 1978.
