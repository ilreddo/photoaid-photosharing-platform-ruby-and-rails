##What is Photo Aid:

**Photo-Aid** is a combination between a photosharing platform and a foundraising website.

For a few years I worked as professional photographer and also nowadays I am consider myself a photo enthusiast. Moreover I alwasy been involved in the charity sector through volonteer work. With **Photo-Aid** I decided to combine this two passions allowin people to donate their photos to the charities. 

When we shoots photos with the mobile phone and cameras we usually shoot 3 or 4 photos of the same subject in order to be able so select the best one. The idea was to create a website that allows the donors to contribute to charitable initiatives with both dontations and with the photos shooted in excess.

From the charitis prospective, Photo Aid allows them to create campaigns and receive donation in form of both money or photos.

**Devise** is a useful gem for implement an authentication system. I had to choose between **Devise** and **Bcrypt** however, due to the duration of the project, I prefereed Devise because is featured with several useful tools for build quickly a strong authentication system.

I used **Carrierwave** and **Rmagick** for managing the images, from the upload to the storing and resizing.

As last gem I used **Stripe** in order to create a check-out for the donors.

The project is based on **three modules**: **Users** (that comprehensive of two role: charity and donor), **Campaigns** and **Photos**. At the start I planned to used for modules but a the end of the first day I dediced to unify the Users and Charities under one module for making esier to implement the authentication system and the reletionships between modules.
