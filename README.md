# Project #2: Photo Aid: Raise funds through Photosharing

##The Project:

As second project of the WDI course at General Assembly I develop a website in **Ruby on Rails**.
Photo-Aid is a combination between a photosharing and a foundraising website.

Photo-Aid allows charities to create campaign and user to contribute uploading photos or buying them.


## Technologies Used: 

The entire project is based on **Ruby on Rails 5** and **Bootstrap 4 Alpha**, with the following gems:

Rmagick

Carrierwave

Devise

For the project I used also the following tools:

Trello

Balasamiq

Draw.io

Photoshop CC

MacDown

Heroku

The project is based on three modules: Users (that comprehensive of two role: charity and donor), campaigns and photos.

The first day of the project I was foused on the wireframe and EDR. Moreover, I planned the rest of the days using Trello as project management tool.

The second day I created the user Module, I created the authentication system usign the gem Devise and, instead of creating a second module for the Charities, I implmented the two role in the user module.

The third day I created three uploader: one for the users profile, one for the campaign logo and one as main uploader for the user's photos.

Monday I started to work on the relationships and I created the main stucture of the website.

On Tuesday I created a quite extensive seed file, fixed numerous bugs and I reached a fully working MVP.

Wednesday: UX fixes for user page, js bootstrap fix, seed file consolidation,
